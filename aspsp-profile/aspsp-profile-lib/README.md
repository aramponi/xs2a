# ASPSP Profile service library
This module provides implementation of ASPSP Profile configuration, using the yaml configuration file (Configuration is described in [top module](../README.md)).

This service may be used as a direct implementation of [aspsp-profile-api](../aspsp-profile-api/README.md) if you use the ASPSP Profile component embedded. It is also used by Standalone implementation in [aspsp-profile-server](../aspsp-profile-server/README.md).
